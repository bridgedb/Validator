#This is an example Config.txt file with the default values in it.
#Please copy this file to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/OPS-IMS and edit it there.
#This config file will be shared with any other program looking for config.txt in the same location.

#The code will attempt to look for the config.txt in a number of places as shown in:
#https://github.com/openphacts/Validator/blob/master/RdfTools/src/uk/ac/manchester/cs/openphacts/valdator/utils/ConfigReader.java
#Main location in order are:
#1. Directly in the directory the code is run from
#2. In $CATALINA_HOME/conf/OPS-IMS
#3. In the ../rdfTools/resources
#4. Directly from the jar or war

#Note 3 and 4 above will locate this actual file so accounts info will not work.
